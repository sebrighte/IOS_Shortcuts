## Public IP - Get Public IP Address for URL

I needed to get my IP address for my domain on an IOS device and have this scheduled to update my vehicle Tracker.
I wanted this to run on my phone to I could message the tracker with the IP address (as DNS not updating)
I created this so it could be used as a standlaone function that could be resued.

I created this as a module which took an input of a URL (A Name) and produced an IP address as a result

e.g. input: "google.com" Output:"142.250.187.238"

I love supporting the **[Download](PublicIP.shortcut)**.
