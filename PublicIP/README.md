## Public IP - Get Public IP Address for URL

I needed to get my IP address for my domain on an IOS device and have this scheduled to update my vehicle Tracker.

I wanted this to run on my phone to I could message the tracker with the IP address (as DNS not updating).

I created this so it could be used as a standlaone function that could be resued.

### Usage: 
Module which took an input of a URL (A Name) and produced an IP address as a result e.g. input: "google.com" Output: "142.250.187.238"
